This is an AI project in which an A* Graph Search is run on a given input 4x4 matrix of randomly assorted integers between 0-15
and a desired output arrangement of the matrix. It uses a manhattan sum of moves (swapping two neighboring cells of the matrix) 
as a heuristic function. An output file copies the input matrix, output matrix, along with the depth of the search tree for
the solution, the number of nodes generated in the tree, the sequence of moves of the blank position (0) to reach the solution,
and the f(n) values of the nodes along the solution path.
